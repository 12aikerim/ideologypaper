<title>The impact of state’s and citizen’s ideology on health insurance spending </title>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>While ideology might have a strong influence on citizen understanding of
various socio-demographic phenomena, such as gender roles, wealth distribution,
ethics, and inequality, it is unclear how does the ideology correlate with other
complicate factors such as healthcare insurance costs. The polarization of the
US’ society brings an interesting case to investigate whether states’ or personal
ideological views affect the costs associated with the health insurance through
the exchanges. In this paper, I focused on the relationship of ideological divide
of the states and their citizens’ out-of-pocket spending on a healthcare.
The guiding research questions can be formulated as 1) How is state’s and
citizen’s ideology connected to household spending on a healthcare insurance?
2) Does the state’s ideology reflect in household out-of-pocket spending in
healthcare and tested via the hypotheses: H1) as the ideology shifts from
liberal to conservative wing, out-of-pocket spending on a healthcare
increases; H2) as state’s citizen’s ideology shifts from liberal to
conservative wing, out-of-pocket spending on a healthcare decreases.
The data on healthcare insurance marketplace on health and dental plans
for the period of 2014 to 2016 from the US Department of Health and Social
Services was used on par with the Measures of Citizen and Government
Ideology by Richard C. Fording at www. rcfording.com/state-ideology-data/ </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The United States being a country with federal presidential structure of
government fosters the variations in ideologies across the states. While many
socio-economic aspects of citizens’ life are affected by demographic features
such as GDP, age, gender proportion, unemployment, etc. the differences whether
one holds to conservative or liberal views also show their impact on individuals’
lives. This paper addresses the issue regarding how well does the ideological
preference determine overall performance and quality of the healthcare insurance
system. To put in a lаymаn’s term, I investigate the correlation between the
conservative ideology and worse health insurance through the exchanges in the
United states. Despite the fact that the definition of “better” or “worse”
insurance is subjective and can not be stated directly, the following section
of literature review will assist me to define what is considered a” good” or a
“bad” health insurance. Besides, it will shed a light on current state of
academic research on the relationship of political ideology to public health.</p>
